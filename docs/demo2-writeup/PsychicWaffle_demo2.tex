\section{Static Analysis}
We used pylint to run static analysis on our python code base. According to their metric, we didn't score too well and had a lot of changes to make. However, the most common mistakes were lines too long, unnecessary parenthesis, and style changes along those lines. Pylint want also unhappy with our naming conventions, however we chose our own naming convention and stuck with it. There were some other errors that we fixed in some files, but combing through all of the lint suggestions and making hundreds of fixes would have taken too long and we unfortunately didn't have time for it. We made most of the glaring changes and left many of the style changes as they were for sanity's sake. The results of our static analysis can be found here (https://github.com/andyg7/4156Project/blob/master/docs/combined-pylint.txt)
